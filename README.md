# Warden
Warden is a web application designed to help minimalists and people with ADHD manage their daily tasks with ease. The app’s interface is simple and intuitive, with a focus on functionality over aesthetics.

The app’s main feature is a to-do list that is optimized for ADHD brains. The list is divided into three categories: High  Priority, Medium Priority and Low Priority. All tasks in the to-do list can be dated and it has color coding for each category.
The app also have a completion bar for the day, displaying how much of your daily activities the user have completed.

Warden’s to-do list system is based on carrying a personal notebook, journal, or organizer at all times. Warden’s to-do list system is designed to help you develop routines and habits, and it can also help you remember things you may have forgotten to do because you can always look back at your lists. The app is free to use and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.
